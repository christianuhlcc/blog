Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

This blog is a personal project to process my learnings, and also to get better at writing. I don't aspire to be a tech influencer, but maybe you find some of these thoughts helpful. The internet is a big place, so I figured it won't hurt to put some more text pages there. If you do find something useful, or if you violently disagree with something, feel free to reach out to me - either via the social links on this page or via email at uhl.christian@googlemail.com. I'm happy to hear either way. 


As such, this blog is raw, largely unedited and partially unhinged. Just to be sure - none of this represents the views of my employer, my government or anyone besides myself.
