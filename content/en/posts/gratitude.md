As I am jumpstarting this blog - *and let's see for how long I can keep it up, as a lot of blogs get started and very few get kept running* - I would like to start this project with some thoughts around **Gratitude**. More precisely, my gratitude towards the life I could build by working in the tech industry. 

We, as software professionals, like to complain a lot. Sometimes over very silly things if DevOps is a different thing than Platform Engineering, sometimes over things that do matter a lot: Like how we managed to mess up the inclusion of underrepresented groups so badly. Or how we waste more energy than some major countries to move bits onto a Blockchain. In any way, we're usually complaining about everything, and that includes me.

But I sometimes forget how _nice_ my life is currently, and that can, to a large degree, be attributed to the salary and the working conditions I am benefitting from. I'll dive a little deeper into both points later, but I want to lay out first where I started in life:

I was born in a small village next to a small town in rural Bavaria, and my parents can be considered working class or "blue collar" workers. That is a pretty privileged life if you compare it to people growing up in non-western countries or active warzones - We had all we needed, good food, a house and two german cars in the ridiculous massive garage before that. Unfortunately, all that life was pretty much always on razor's edge - We were not in debt (besides the mortgage), but the running expenses of a family of 4 with that lifestyle didn't leave much room for error. Unemployment was a big scare for us. This had a few nasty consequences:

* Money was always a scared resource, doing anything extraordinary was the source of many debates. This mindset of frugality has stayed with me until now (looking at my disheveled t-shirts full of holes), and almost threw a wrench into my career aspirations: Getting a computer was a big deal.

* Jobs could not to be changed, as it was too dangerous - we were always at the whim of my parent's employers. When they did something bad (like asking for unpaid overtime, or not compensating business travel expenses), we just swallowed it. 

* My parents were away a lot - working and making money for the family, and my Grandparents were quite busy handling us, unruly kids. 

## So what's different for me?

### 1 The competitive salaries of the tech sector

If you look at some (biased) surveys like [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/t/software-engineer/locations/germany) you see that 2022 Salaries mention a median of 83.385€ and a p75 of 103.000€. That might be biased a little as levels.fyi is more frequented by big-tech employees, not people working in software for non-software organizations. [Statista](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/204507/umfrage/brutto-jahresverdienst-von-softwareentwicklern-in-deutschland/
) measures a median income of 53.034€. I think this difference can be well explained by [this post](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/) about the trimodal nature of tech salaries. 

As I am doing personally very well after a good decade in tech - a Senior Engineering Manager Salary is a bit better than a median Senior Engineering Salary, but even before the last 2 or 3 promotions I could already live very differently: I always have enough fuck-you-money to feel absolutely free. If my job annoys me, I can walk out on the spot because I have enough savings to keep everything running for a year+. This also enabled me to -just now- take 7 months of parental leave for my child without getting the family into any trouble. This feeling of financial freedom is unparalleled, as I remember my parents worrying and arguing about money a lot. And even more, I can live in a house - something I never thought was possible in the economic realities of Germany in the 2020s.

Seems to me that money doesn't buy happiness, but it makes most reasons for unhappiness disappear. To be happy is a lot easier in such a situation.

If I had stayed in "my lane" as a working-class kid, doing an "Ausbildung" in the "Handwerk" [going into the trades], I wouldn't have any of this. No House, no parental leave, and a ton of worries on top of that. 

### 2 The working conditions

As tech is generally an employee's market, even during itss ups and downs, we get treated pretty well. I see a lot of new grads coming in and worrying about a buch of stuff other people would just look confused at:

* Most jobs don't have career progression or a career ladder or anything like that. You get a job, and then you do that job until you die or you get laid off. Enjoy your 2% bi-annual raise. 

* We can work remotely (a lot). I can spend time with my daughter in the mornings or in the evenings
