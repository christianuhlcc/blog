## Follow doctrine

This is one of my larger learnings of the last year(s), and something I had to learn the hard-ish way as I did it wrong in my first leadership role, and watched people struggle hard in my current role. It's about following "Doctrine", avoiding the problem of the week, and distinguishing between these two.

I don't particularly like the term itself, as it sounds quite militaristic, but I don't have a better one yet. What I mean by that (and I borrowed it from Wardley's Twitter rambles about Wardley Mapping), is that at any given time, any company has a few fundamental truths that it operates on. One of them (as I experienced it) could be ***hypergrowth*** or finding product market fit or getting profitable. It could be any of them. If there is none, I would assume your company is just struggling along the tide, and you should probably look for another place to work. The same goes for rapidly switching "fundamental truths" before any doctrine has yielded any results - a sure sign that the top leadership doesn't have its act together.

If you are finding yourself in that situation of hypergrowth, you are supposed to grow your teams and headcount as fast as you can, with the goal of "achieving maximum impact for the company". That means thinking about "If I had twice the teams and people, what else could I be delivering additionally? Or doing in parallel?". You don't want to fall into the build trap of just generating meaningless output with no outcomes. 

But if you don't internalize doctrine, you might fall into the trap of locally optimizing: Maybe, for the current thing that your teams are building, adding more people will likely not help. You have read the "Mythical man month" and you're rightfully afraid. Au contraire, onboarding more people will slow down your current execution. But if you take a stance for no growth in a company that has hypergrowth, you will be chewed out by the org and tossed aside as "someone who stands in the way".

So what I suggest you should be doing is 
1. Understand the current doctrine 
2. Plan how you can use that to your Organisation's advantage
3. Propose and execute

In a way, this advice may sound opportunistic, and to a bit that's true. But the way I made my peace with this is that there is hopefully a strong strategic reason behind it that will delight your users and propel the business forward.

## Choose the tactics

So here's the difference where I start being rebellious. Every company I worked in so far had, to some degree, a *problem of the week*. That's where everyone's eyes were on, but as quickly as these topics come, they'll leave equally fast. You can spend your whole leadership tenure running after them and making a dent toward these topics. Usually, they are also reasonable to work on: 

* Our error rate is too high
* Too many outages last week
* Performance is bad
* Cloud spending is too high
* The Swedish Market demands more meatballs

While these are examples of "problem of the week", most of them could be longer, serious strategic endeavors. But often, they are driven by a key event: Maybe the CEO got an email from his university friend, who's also a CEO, and will be quickly forgotten for the next hype next week.

For this kind of problem, I would suggest being _compliant_ - that means doing something about it, getting some quick wins in, and allocating a bit of capacity - But not going all in. Your people will get whiplash from the weekly turns. This will also torpedo something very important: 

## Your strategy

For whatever thing you are a leader for, I expect you to have some kind of vision for where this thing should go in the next half year / year / two years. And you need to make small, consistent steps towards that goal, and make sure that goal is in line with the company doctrine. But if you just go with the tactics, you are a waiter and not a chef (to ), catering to your stakeholder's whims without delivering a truly excellent org, and you will be stuck wherever you are

### TLDR
A little anarchist mindset goes a long way, but be smart about what battles you pick :-)
