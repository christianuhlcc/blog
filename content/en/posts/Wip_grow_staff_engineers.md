A part of being a Senior leader is managing, growing and promoting Senior+ ICs (Individual Contibutors). I collected some thoughts about how a Engineering Manager can support People in their growth journey. Remember: Their success is your success, and having one or more Staff Engineers will allow you to kick in a few metaphorical doors towards larger organisational impact

As a disclaimer, I have successfully gotten people into a "lead developer" role, which in Personio is an intermediate step between Senior and Staff, and might map directly to Staff in other career frameworks. 

## Staff Engineers are diverse Individuals 
It sounds pretty obvious, or course. But besides 'diversity' from a Demographic perspective, I believe that the workstyle of Staff Engineers is quite broad, even though they share a career level. An as all models are wrong, but some are useful, it helps me to break down the Staff Role into a few Archetypes:

* The rocket surgeon
* The tunnel dig machine
* The archeologist
* The street cleaner

Important here is that while all stereotypes are equally valuable, the best organisational need for each stereotype might be in different demand. You only need a rocket surgeon if you have enough complexity and load on a system to justify this persons presence. Before that, you probably want to fill that need via consultants. That's also an explanation why such Staff engineers gravitate to expert roles in consultancies, or very big tech orgs. If the organisational demand is not there, it will be insanely hard to promote such a person tonthe staff level
