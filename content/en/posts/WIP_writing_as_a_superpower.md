We all need to become better at technical writing - no matter if we are Software Engineers, Product Managers, Engineering Managers or Designers. In the last decade of working in tech, I found one of the most remarkable shifts in how we work to be the switch to remote work. Especially before the pandemic and the hyper-inflation of Videocalls, our mode of work shifted a lot towards more asyncronous communication. This includes more Emails, chat messages, techincal documents and project plans. Your writing will influence how you are percieved by others and how well you can influence the organisation you're working in.

## Writing levels the field

I personally applaud this change a lot, because it allows for a very subtle shift in power: Previously, most impactful decisions were made ad-hoc in in-person meetings. Within these meetings, sometimes the loudest and most agressive people had the strongest influence, and even more frequently, the people who were good at persuation had most influence. This didn't always lead to the best ideas being the ones considered. 

With a more async culture, arguments can be prepared beforehand, and researched deeper. This allows different styles of thinkers to bring their best to a decision, even if the final decision happens syncronously.
